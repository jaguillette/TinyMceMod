TinyMCE Mod
===========

This plugin for Omeka is set up to overwrite some TinyMCE settings, and was made out of a desire to change the behavior of TinyMCE to make it more permissive of different HTML tags without changing the globals.js file in core Omeka. The plugin loads tinyMCEmod.js into the admin head, and sets three settings. Feel free to fork this and make your own changes to TinyMCE in the same way.
